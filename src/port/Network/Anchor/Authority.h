// Generic network authority registry.
//
// An "activity" is anything where one client must run the real logic and the others
// follow (minigames, battles, boss fights). The client that starts the activity claims
// authority; everyone else gates their local simulation on NetAuthority_IsSelf().
//
// Semantics:
//  - Offline (or before Anchor init), NetAuthority_IsSelf() is always true, so vanilla
//    single-player code paths run unmodified.
//  - While connected but unclaimed, IsSelf() is also true: every client is locally
//    authoritative for ambient behavior until someone actually starts the activity.
//  - Simultaneous claims resolve deterministically: the lowest clientId wins. Both
//    sides apply the same rule on receive, so they converge without extra round trips;
//    the loser observes NetAuthority_IsSelf() turning false.
//  - Authority is auto-released when the owner disconnects or leaves the activity's
//    map (each activity is tied to one map in Authority.cpp).
//
// To add a new gated activity: add an enum entry below and its map to sActivityMap in
// Authority.cpp.
